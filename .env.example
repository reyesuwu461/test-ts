# Admin creation code used by the MSW mock when creating an admin user.
# Keep this secret in your local environment (do not commit).

# When using MSW during development this can be true (the dev helper already
# sets VITE_MSW=true for the dev server, but it's ok to keep it here).

# Optional: set a base API URL if you later swap the mock for a real API.
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5173

# MongoDB connection string examples (used by server/index.js)
# For local Docker or local MongoDB:
